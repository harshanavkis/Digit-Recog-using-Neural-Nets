A three layer neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
=======================================================================================================================================
Though there are many frameworks for deep learning that help us to implement a neural network easily, many of them don't help to clearly understand what is going on behind the scenes. I  built a three layered neural network from scratch using only numpy as my dependency. This helped me understand the crucial concepts of backpropagation
